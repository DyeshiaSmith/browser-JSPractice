    <p>Im 25 years old. Graduated highschool in 2013, and have been working since then. at this time in my life im working full time at a car plant in <strong> Wentzville, MO.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>I want a change in career field. Something that requires me to always learn, and in a field thats constantly growing. Ive been blessed with a physically demanding job, that only gives us two off days a month, but I want better for myself. Which is why I chose to become a <em> Software Developer</em>
